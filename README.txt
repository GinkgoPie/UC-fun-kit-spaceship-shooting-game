Game Title:     Ship Game.


Objective:      Each player has a ship of three pieces. The objective is to shoot  
                the other players ship three times in order to win the game. A
                piece is lost if the opposing player shoots a bullet from the same
                column that the player is in. A player can avoid being shot by
                moving their ship left to right.

Controls:       There are 3 different player inputs: Left, Right and Push
                Left - Moving the navswitch left moves the ship left (surprise)
                Right - Moving the navswitch right moves the ship right
                Push - Pushing the navswitch in causes the player to shoot a bullet

Setup:	        - Plug in both Funkits and load the program
		        - Set orientation of both Funkits so that both boards 'Up's' are
			    facing each other (USB connection ports facing each other)
		        - A dimly lit room and clear path free of obstructions for better IR connectivity
                - To start playing, press the navswitch down

Key Features:   - Players' bullet appears on the opponents board and interacts with it
		        - Ability to interact with a ship using the Funkits' navswitch
